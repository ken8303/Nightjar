# Nightjar beta handoff

The latest local code passed 475 automated tests, TypeScript, lint, production build and Cloudflare packaging dry-run. Changes are committed locally for a batch push through GitHub Desktop. No push or deployment was performed by the development agent.

## After your batch push

1. Check the GitHub validation workflow result for the pushed commit. Local passing checks do not establish a hosted CI result.
2. Check the Cloudflare build and final HTTPS origin. Confirm the planner, weather, manifest, service worker and offline fallback there. Follow [CLOUDFLARE.md](./CLOUDFLARE.md) for build configuration.
3. Use test entries for the checks below. Verify any backup/recovery file is actually received before clearing text or leaving a failed-save view.

## Phone acceptance checks

| Flow | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Camera discovery | In Safari or Chrome on HTTPS, choose the correct observing site and intentionally start camera/motion. Turning the phone moves predicted labels; stopped/paused video hides live labels. Check a known bright object and alignment. These are predicted positions, not image recognition. |
| Camera display | Fullscreen, portrait/landscape, reference thumbnails and scrollable controls remain usable. Closing or backgrounding stops camera/motion/screen awake; return does not silently restart hardware. |
| Installation and update | Install from the browser/home-screen flow. A pending install cannot be tapped repeatedly. For a real deployed update, save/copy unfinished text first and confirm the selected site/time survive the explicit update. |
| Offline return | Open online once and save test plans. Reopen without connectivity: the fallback shows saved device data. Full planner startup, fresh positions and weather offline are not supported promises. Restore connectivity and verify return. |
| Numeric entry | Try a decimal comma such as focal 12,5 and confirm a saved setup shows 12.5 mm. Invalid/unfinished text stays in the draft and disables relevant calculations/exports. Verify the native keyboard permits required signs and separators. |
| Failed saves | Keep the view open. Direct review actions return to time, coordinates, imaging, diary, target-note or site-name recovery. Retry after storage is usable; verify retained text and original observation metadata. |
| Files and accessibility | Confirm actual receipt/import/printing of intended files. Test screen-reader labels, focus after review/close, large text, and short landscape screens. Local screenshots and download-prepared messages do not prove these native behaviours. |

Physical iPhone/Android sensors, installed-PWA lifecycle, native keyboards/readers/files and hosted GitHub/Cloudflare results remain unverified. Detailed evidence and release gates are in [RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md); development history is in [DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md](./DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md).
